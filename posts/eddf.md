Mainz.

**Hotel** - [Hilton Mainz](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/qmzhitw-hilton-mainz/). Located on the Rhine river in Mainz, it's 10 minutes from center city and about 18 minutes from the Mainz Hbf.

**Food** - I ate a DÃ¶ner. It's Germany... they're easy to find.

**Food/Drinks** - [The Glenmore](https://theglenmore.com.au). Located at The Rocks, this iconic bar has "harbour views & great food." It won't disappoint.

**Running** - Run along the Rhine. Leaving the Hilton from its main entrance, make the first right and you'll run into a road that parallels the Rhine. It seems that you can follow the river longer if you run South as opposed to North.
