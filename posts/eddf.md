Mainz.

**Hotel** - [Hilton Mainz](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/qmzhitw-hilton-mainz/). Located on the Rhine river in Mainz, it's 10 minutes from center city and about 18 minutes from the Mainz Hbf.

**Food** - I ate a DÃ¶ner. It's Germany... they're easy to find.

**Unverified Food** - I heard the food and drinks are good at "[Ice House](https://www.eisgrub.de)" and "[Rosis](https://www.yelp.com/biz/rosis-restaurant-schinderhannes-mainz)."

**Running** - Run along the Rhine. Leaving the Hilton from its main entrance, make the first right and you'll run into a road that parallels the Rhine. It seems that you can follow the river longer if you run South as opposed to North.
