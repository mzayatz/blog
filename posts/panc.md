My inaugural post. It's apt that it's on Anchorage&mdash;one of my favorite cities to spend the night. The flavor of the air in Anchorage reminds me of Reykjavik or Tallinn. The brisk wind feels clean and mountains seem to find their way into every photo.

**Hotel** - [The Hotel Captain Cook](https://captaincook.com).  Wood, wood everywhere. The hotel exudes peak 1970s glamour and luxury.

**Food** - [Fire Island Rustic Bakeshop](https://fireislandbread.com). A truly impressive selection of fresh bread, sandwiches, and pastries. I ate a maple cupcake, a ham sandwich, and scone. All were amazing.

**Running** - [Tony Knowles Coastal Trail](https://www.alaska.org/detail/tony-knowles-coastal-trail). Fairly flat, you'll find simple views at mile marker zero. The trail follows the coast and becomes truly scenic as you work your way past the city limits.
