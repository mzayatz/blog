Sydney Harbour. 

**Hotel** - [Sydney Harbour Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/sydmc-sydney-harbour-marriott-hotel-at-circular-quay/overview/). Centrally located by both the Circular Quay Train Station and Ferry Terminal, you can get anywhere in Sydney from here. 

**Coffee** - [Skittle Lane](https://skittlelane.com/) and [Artificer](http://artificercoffee.com). Artificer is a about 20 minute transit ride, but worth it.

**Food** - [The Dutch Smuggler](https://www.dutchsmuggler.com.au). Try the Magic Mi Goreng toastie. You won't be disappointed. Great coffee too.

**Food** - [Frankie's Pizza](https://swillhouse.com/venues/frankies-pizza/). Didn't go myself, but I heard the pizza is legit.

**Food/Drinks** - [The Glenmore](https://theglenmore.com.au). Located at The Rocks, this iconic bar has "harbour views & great food." It won't disappoint.

**Drinks** - [Palmer & Co](https://merivale.com/venues/palmerandco/?utm_source=googlemybusiness_venue&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=googlemybusiness_venue_organic_palmeranco&utm_content=website). Great atmosphere. Great charcuterie. Great times.

**Running** - [Circular Quay Ferry Terminal](https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=200020#/). You'll see the Sydney Opera House, Royal Botanic Gardens, and more.
