How to search Jepp documents from Jepp FD Pro X.

## Series Intro 
Commercial airline pilots use Jeppesen FliteDeck Pro X (JeppFD Pro X)* to reference charts and other important aviation data. The app implements a ton of great features. 

This is the first post in a series of planned posts describing lesser-known features of the app. When new posts become available, you'll find them tagged with "jepp-tips."

## Searching Pubs
Most pilots use the search box on the map page to search for airports, waypoints, etc. However, it can also search through the Jeppesen route manuals. Instead of typing in a waypoint, type in any word. For example, if you type "expanded," the app will return information regarding expanded circling airspace.
