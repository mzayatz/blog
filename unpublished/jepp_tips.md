Tips for getting the most out of JeppFD Pro.

## Introduction 
Commercial airline pilots use Jeppesen FliteDeck Pro X (JeppFD Pro X)* to reference charts and other important aviation data. The app implements a ton of great features. I go over a few of the lesser known ones below.

## Searching Pubs

Most pilots use the search box on the map page to search for airports, waypoints, etc. However, it can also search through the Jeppesen route manuals. Instead of typing in a waypoint, type in any word. For example, if you type "expanded," the app will return information regarding expanded circling airspace. 

## Searching Taxiways
When used on the "AMM," the search box can find and highlight taxiways. Just type in the letter of the desired taxiway. It'll even show partial results.

## Show Organized Tracks 
#### (video pending)
If selected on in settings, the app will draw both Atlantic and Pacific organized track systems on the airway layer. If you tap a track, the app will show information about that track.

## Mark Position vs Waypoint
A long tap on the map page will show options for saving a position. For electronic plotting, I recommend using "Mark Position" over "Waypoint." Points entered using "Mark Position" automatically erase when creating a new route. Points entered as "Waypoints" persist even after a new route is created. They will need to be deleted manually.

## Split Screen View

The app supports split screen view. See Apple for an in-depth explanation of split screen view and multitasking on the iPad.
