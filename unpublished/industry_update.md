*FUD (noun) - fear, uncertainty, and doubt*

## Introduction 
Earlier this year, I made it a goal to read world / national / business news websites less. Since 9/11, I've found myself reflexively checking these sites multiple times a day. I guess I wanted to stay up on current events and be the first to tell my friends and family about the latest world happenings. 

Recently, I discovered that my instinctual browsing habits was interfering with my ability to "live in the moment." This was part of a broader problem of mine: being satisfied with life. 

Since I can remember, I've been constantly trying to make my mark on the world. Produce something of value. Earn lots of money. I think I really need to appreciate what I have. I don't think it's healthy to always be pushing for more.
