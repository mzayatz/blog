## Aviation
Aviation is like software development&mdash;it can be overwhelmingly complicated and often the documentation sucks. Here you'll find the various assets I've created to teach pilots various concepts.

Note: [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) is used to open .sketch files.

### McDonnell Douglas MD-11
- MD-11 Navigation Display [(.sketch)](/resources/projects/aviation/md11_nav_display.sketch) [(.webp)](/resources/projects/aviation/md11_nav_display.webp) [(.png)](/resources/projects/aviation/md11_nav_display.webp)
I created this to support [my post](/posts/nav_descent/) describing how to compute an idle path descent using an aircraft's navigation display.
